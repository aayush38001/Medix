	<br />Information is restricted to authorized users like chairmen and directors of hospitals and few registered users like receptionist.
	<br />This webpage will provide medical and personal information of the registered users to the hospital.
	<br />Using this information hospitals can provide fast service to the registered users.
	<br />Through this software the user need not wait in the busy queues of hospitals in order to fill the forms and formalities. We also take care of your insurance.
	<br /><center>Welcome to a tension free Hospital experience!</center></p>
